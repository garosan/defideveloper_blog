Two months ago, I wanted to start this project, but I didn't know what to put here. I’ve been quietly following my learning path for more than six months now—participating in hackathons and contributing to open-source projects—but on days like today, the landscape looks more challenging than usual.

A few days ago, Argentine President Javier Milei had a fiasco promoting (or rather, broadcasting) a crypto scam on his personal account. Two days ago, we witnessed the biggest hack in crypto history—Lazarus Group tricked the ByBit team and made off with $1.4 billion in ETH and other tokens. People are arguing and fighting all day over culprits, solutions, an Ethereum rollback, criticizing Vitalik as a leader, the Ethereum Foundation, and Ethereum as a project. Others are disappointed because Solana and [pump.fun](http://pump.fun) wiped out their savings. Meanwhile, "leaders" and "builders" are busy creating the [pump.fun](http://pump.fun) of X blockchain, the [pump.fun](http://pump.fun) of derivatives, NFTs, undercollateralized loans... It all seems like absolute chaos.

And when you’re trying to finally break into the industry—not just as a user or a spectator from the sidelines—even more questions and complexities arise. What course should I take? Which ecosystem, which vertical, which language? Vyper, Solidity, or Cairo? Which chain should I focus on? Base launched a bootcamp, Scroll, Abstract, Mantle... The sheer overload feels like waking up after a brutal hangover, questioning your life decisions. Extending the party, going full-time crypto. But here we are, markets keep bleeding, week is still young and may bring along some more disappointing news but it feels like its not time to go home yet.

There’s so much left to learn and so many things to explore still. If you’re curious, if you have a legitimate passion to build cool stuff and solve real problems, and have a high risk-high reward mentality, its not time for us to go home yet.
